        Hi! My name is Salman and I am a senior at the Illinois Institute of Technology and will
        be graduating this May with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. My passion with biomedical
        engineering started with my love for biology and math, which led me to explore my career
        options in healthcare. Following graduation, I plan to work for an engineering company
        and hopefully continue learning more about the biomedical field while gaining experience in
        research and development. In my free time, I enjoy painting, playing basketball with
        friends and playing the piano. I am also involved in a non-profit organization called
        MEDLIFE which provides medical and structural support to low income areas.

        <h5>Work Experience</h5>
        <p>
          I am currently a researcher at the IIT Medical Imaging Research Center whre I am working
          on tumor simulation modeling using MATLAB. I also am designing a polyp retrieval device
          in my BME Senior Design class. Additionally, I developed a MATLAB code to
          quantitatively model cavity growth in mice.
