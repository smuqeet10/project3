      <h2>Biomedical Projects</h2>
      <p>Throughout my college experience,  I have made it a point to focus on Biomedical projects
        which can challenge me and make use of the information I have been taught over the past
        four years in the area of medical instrument design as well as biotechnology development.
      </p>
      <h3>Senior Design- Polypectomy Retrieval Device</h3>
      <p>Worked with an interdisciplinary group of Biomedical Engineering students to develop a
         polypectomy retrieval device. Specifically, I was involved in the sketching of the
         engineering drawings of all components, as well as using SolidWorks and other computer
         softwares to help develop multiple prototypes and iterations of the final product.
      </p>
      <h4>Mathematical Model of the Development of Dental Caries</h4>
      <p>Helped in developing MATLAB code to mathematically model the devleopment of the bacteria
        S.mutans in rats. This involved designing code that is able to quantifiably model as well as
        predict the concentration of bacteria growth versus time based on published research.
